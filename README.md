This tool provides more robust functionality for converting text to table. It helps to ensure that Table Styles are applied
properly when converting text to table. It currently allows you to: 

* Clear existing paragraph and/or character styles to ensure your Table Style object styles apply properly. 
* Designate if existing rows in the selected text should be headers and/or footers (top rows for headers, bottom rows for footers)

There currently is no functionality for converting text that has the same row and column separators (Tab and Tab, Comma and Comma, etc)
